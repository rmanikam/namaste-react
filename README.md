#Namaste React

git branch -M main - I am creating default branch as main instead of master

git add. - we are adding all the files that need to go inside commit

git remote add origin - this step i have to do once to setup our local to remote repository

Now I have added origin so i can push all my code to remote

git push origin main means i am pushing the code to origin means (remote origin) and main branch on the origin on the remote
